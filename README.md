# Studycraft

This mod allows you to use a **custom **Quizlet** flashcard set** and answer questions in-game. It introduces a new survival mechanism by increasing the time for hunger to deplete, but earning back hunger points for each correct answer.

## Open the Studycraft configuration screen
By default, press Y to open the screen. You can also change the hotkey in the settings.
To answer a question, give yourself a Quiz Card and right-click to use it in game.
Depending on the difficulty set in the config screen, you will gain hunger points for each correct answer and get damage for every incorrect answer.
